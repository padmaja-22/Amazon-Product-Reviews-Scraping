0,Govinda Dasa,5.0,The Saviour of the Brand,7 June 2019,"It is a known fact that many people are disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro's pricing, size, thickness, bulkiness, bugs like phantom touches, etc. At least me, being a OnePlus fan from past so many years, was very much disappointed with OnePlus 7 Pro, in every aspect.But however, this OnePlus 7 completely restores back the lost glories of the OnePlus history. This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel."

Camera - The back camera of 48MP and 5MP is completely bogus. It misses on clarity and detail.2. Heating issues : Update my phone, used camera in night mode and shooted a video in 4K 60 FPS. Believe me I was not able to hold the phone for sometime, it was really heated.Reported the issue to OnePlus, no reply since last two days.Tried reporting on Amazon App, it made me download a system testing app bit it failed to find the problem as well.', ""If you are planning to upgrade your phone from OnePlus 5T & lower models, if you want to save money from your budget and if you are confused between 7 & 7pro, then definitely go for OnePlus 7. This is a much better upgraded version of low budget smart phone than any other phone in the market today.- Performance: Excellent 5/5- Features: Very Good 4.5/5- UI experience: Excellent 5/5- Battery: More than enough 5/5- Speakers: Better than a lot of earlier versions of OnePlus 4/5- Camera: Missing the wide angle lens & slight difference (lower end) in the nightscape, else pretty much same features to 7pro. Don't even try to compare it with Pixel 3- Weight: Very apt for a 6.4 inch screen smart phone. Much lighter than 7pro- RAM: 8GB version does superb with more than 100GB of applications. No lag at all.- Gaming: PUBG does really well with Ultra fps & HDR graphics. No lag at all even when connected with mobile data. (Unless ofcourse you are in some remote non-network areas).If you are ready to put 15k more for some more features than all above things, than you can buy 7pro. Else, this would most probably satisfy your needs as well as your wallet! Go for it.."", ""I was so confused between the OnePlus 7 and the Oppo Reno 10X Zoom, but finally, I made up my mind and bought the former. And there is no regret whatsoever! Here are a few reasons why I chose the OnePlus 7 over the Reno 10X Zoom.1. It has complete water-resistant seals and coatings, while the Reno 10X Zoom absolutely lacks any.2. The OnePlus uses a faster UFS 3.0 storage over the Reno's UFS 2.1. While there may not be a huge difference in app loading speeds, there are so many other benefits of the newer system, like faster app installation, significantly quicker file transfer and copy-paste operations.3. OnePlus uses high-quality AMOLED panel made by Samsung. On the other hand, Oppo has sourced out the Reno's display from some unknown Chinese manufacturer. While the display quality is not that different, the OnePlus 7's panel can get much brighter with adaptive brightness, which helps in superior outdoor visibility.4. The alert slider of OnePlus devices is quite useful for me.5. Personally, I am not a fan of the pop-out camera mechanisms. I have seen multiple Oppo/Vivo devices with malfunctioning selfie camera module flooding the service center in Kolkata. Apart from the durability concern, it makes the phone more prone to liquid damage and delays face unlock.6. I am a huge fan of Oxygen OS and appreciate OnePlus’s regular updates and bug fixes. The OnePlus phones actually become better with time. However, Oppo is known for missing update timelines and the icons of their Colour OS is absolutely distasteful.Lastly, features like DC diming, Fnatic Mode, etc. are quite useful indeed.That said, the Oppo Reno 10X Zoom does have some advantages.1. Its zoom camera actually comes handy in some situations.2. Oppo packs a decent Type-C earphone with the Reno 10X Zoom.3. The notch-less larger display looks fantastic.4. There is also an Rs. 3000 exchange bonus if you wish to give away an old Oppo smartphone.I could have also waited for the Redmi K20 Pro, but its lack of Optical Image Stabilization made my choice easier. Moreover, Xiaomi’s flash sale model is frustrating.Coming back to my OnePlus 7, it is a fantastic device with no lag or stutter whatsoever. The camera is quite good on its own and will get better with the upcoming update next week.

Amazingly fast speed - The phone everything with ease that is thrown at it. The Ram Management is Amazing.You can see the antutu scores.2. Looks- Looks and feels premium in Hand. The mirror Grey looks amazing in Daylight(without cover)3. Screen- Amoled is the best screen for general day to day use.4. Gaming - 256 GB combined with 8 GB ram and Snapdragon 855 Plus the 6.41 inch screen. Gaming is no brainer.Now the Major disadvantages and why is it a deal breaker -The Cons :1. Very HIGH RADIATION LEVEL. I realized it after seeing the box. IT has 1.0 Sar. Other phones have as low as .3-.4 Sar level.2. Phone is quite heavy compared to other phones of the same size. You cannot hold it comfortably in one Hand.3. UI- The software is Fast but boring. You cannot customize apps in Folders and I hate to scroll 100's of apps everytime. NO ONE HANDED USE Optimization in software.4. The touch is non responsive sometimes. While playing pubg Sometimes you are unable to trigger the shoot button. And as a result you can die and forget the chicken dinner. See the attached video where it takes a second to process touches.5. The size is also uncomfortable to game for longer hours. Hands pain while holding it for long time.6. NO HEADPHONE JACK. NO OTG FOR TYPE C Either. Samsung phones still have it.7. The Camera - Major reason why is it a deal Breaker. The photos come out blurred. It is not able to take photos instantly. It takes a second to process and the subject has already moved by then. I had expected better performance after paying 38000rs.VERDICT-There are lot of phones for Gaming in the market now which offer speed and reliability.They are quite small as well to hold.If you are a oneplus fan and updating from O5 or 5t then go for it. OP6 Guys should either take PRO or consider other phones.Thank you for reading my review.I hope this review helps you in Deciding whether this phone is meant for you or not."", ""First thing it's with great effort I ordered my OP7. Surprisingly I received it next day. I was on high. But after setup I noticed that the sound of the caller is echoing & grid like I'm talking on speaker phone. Plus the volume increases and decreases automatically.Secondly I can't swipe from Speed Dial to call history to contacts. Have to check individual tab to navigate...All my excitement vanished after trying all the possible solutions.Feeling disappointed as I keep advocating n promoting OnePlus from last 4 yrs for its premium quality products and services.Regards"", 'I have used 1+1, 1+X, 1+3T and 1+5T. Just got this beauty in hands yesterday evening and I would say its a class apart. Mirror grey finish looks awesome. Screen is brighter than its predecessors. I liked the stereo speakers output. Camera\'s first impression is good. Just one thing I didn\'t like is that OnePlus should have kept the size to 6"" as it still feels big and bulky in hand. ATLEAST should have sized and weighted same like OnePlus 6.', ""DELIVERY:First of all, delivered within 48 hrs from Bangalore to Kerala and the package was not bad.DESIGN:Coming to the phone, design is identical to the 6T. Compact, well balanced weight distribution, and slim. Feels premium in hand.DISPLAY:Display is absolutely amazing, no issues with the colour reproduction, darks(blacks) feels exactly dark thanks to the optic AMOLED panel. We won't notice that well placed drop notch as it is well placed.PERFORMANCE:Performance, actually I don't want to say anything about OnePlus when sit comes to performance. BEAST!!! Starting from booting up the phone you'll experience a flawless smoothness and RAM management, I don't know how they're doing this!!! So nothing to worry about performance.GAMING:Played PUBG for an hour both in HD graphics Ultra frame rate and in Low graphics extreme frame rate. Even though there is no issues with playing in high graphics I would recommend playing in low and extreme frame rate. You'll see butter smoothness and very easy to play the game. Also played PES(Pro Evolution Soccer) and in this game I would recommend to play in high graphics and 60fps. So gaming paet so far so good.Camera:Coming to the camera frankly I just took only some samples as I got the phone in the evening last day.I'll update you regarding that later. But my initial impression is not bad, anyway I don't wanna tell how it performs in different conditions before I test it.Battery:Again like I said in the camera section, just used this phone for 6 to 7 hours, so I can't tell much about battery, but definitely initial impressions are good, booted my phone with 70 to 80% battery and lasted for 4 to 4.5 hours. I think this battery can give upto 7 to 7.5 screen on time for a normal usage. Charging speed is fast, even though it's not having warp charging dash charging is enough for 3700mah battery. Full charge in 1 hr 30 minutes. First 50% is so fast like 30 to 35 minutes.Conclusion:Worth for the price range, if you can sacrifice the headphone jack then this one is for you.

And they have outdone themselves once again with the OnePlus7.At first I was contemplating buying the OnePlus7 Pro but then felt that I wasn't too keen on spending so much for a phone that I would ideally use for two years. A below 40k phone is something I feel is worth for me. Then I learnt about the OnePlus 7 and after quite some research, I purchased this. Its been over 24 hours of using this new phone and I've tried everything that I would use the phone for before writing this review.1. Packaging - Well thought and aptly done. Comes with a transparent casing which has a premium quality feel. I always prefer the transparent covers. It also came with the Dash Charger and Simtray pin.2. Bootup - Inserted the Sim cards and turned it on. Logged on to Google account and there the sync begins by google. Once that was done, I ran the OnePlus Switch app and within the next 2 hours, all my data, pics, videos, music, apps, messages and everything else from the previous OnePlus3T was on my phone. I was good to go.3. Charging - I didn't find a difference between the OnePlus3T and the OnePlus7 in terms of charge timing. There is a minor heat up that happens during charging but lesser than the predecessors. One full charge has lasted me 24 hours comfortably with all my high usage.4. Performance - The phone is extremely fluidic and there isn't any slag even when running multiple applications and data, thanks to the 8GB RAM.5. Camera - I've taking a few shots between my old phone and this. And there is a substantial quality difference in the images. Moreover the features of the cam like pro mode, nightscape, panaroma and time laspe work perfectly with great image quality. The front camera is also extremely clear.6. Comparison between OnePlus7 Pro and OnePlus7 - The major differences between these two variants were the triple rear camera vs the dual rear camera, the pop up front cam vs the notched cam on the screen (I wanted to avoid the pop up cam especially around little kids), the resolution of the display (which is equally good in OnePlus7), the battery capacity (250mAh can hardly make a difference), Size of screen (OnePlus 7 is slightly smaller and thinner, which I like). With these differences, I was convinced that the OnePlus 7 was a better product for me in terms of value for money. Paying almost 30% more for minor performance upgrades that I may not need, wasn't justified to me.Yes, if photography is your main focus then the OnePlus7 Pro makes sense, but then for that I have my DSLR.Overall this is the perfect phone for any application and with the price point, it is absolutely a must buy compared to all the other phones with a snapdragon 855 series processor.Click below button if you found this Helpful!"", 'I request the costumers to not buy it online as the replacement of a defective product is inconvenient to the costumer as the technician who visit for inspection share wrong information.I received a defective product and there have been two technician visits till now. Even the costumer support does not help. My return window has also closed now and the I am still using a defective product', ""It's very fast mobile as I was using 6T but the only inconvenience is that they do not provide C-type earphone connector otherwise it is classiest mobile for use.Nightscape is really wonderful"", ""I've been using it for 2 days now and this seems to be the perfect one. The camera is unbelievable, the RAM management and battery backup, everything is splendid"", ""Pros: 1) Best processor - Lightning quick performance. Even beats OP 7Pro on benchmarks and speed due to the smaller display and smaller resolution.2) Fingerprint scanner and face unlock is fast as flash.3) Dash Charging is almost equal to the warp charger because of the charging speed after 50%.4) Screen On Time - 7 hrs for a typical use without adaptive battery settings on.5) Amazing display and amazing in hand feel.6) Camera is good but not up to the I phone or pixel level, but it's not a hardware issue, as this phone has the Sony IMX 586 sensors, it perform magically on Google Camera. So just matter of updates which will bring the camera level to top. Recently OP pro received the 9.5.7 camera update and it improves the camera to the level of the other flagships. So hopefully this will receive that update too.7) Oxygen OS 9.5.4 with Android Pie is smooth and better compared to stock Android though it retains the skin and features of stock OS.8) Not a tinge of heating at all. I can't remember a time when I had to flip the phone or feel a warmth on the body.9) Built quality is premium.10) I'm not a pop up camera fan. So I'm happy that I'm getting a tear drop notch instead. Saves a few battery for face unlock without the motorized cam.11) Stereo speakers is loud and clear. Sound quality with Dolby Atmos is lit.12) Call quality and noise cancellation is premium.13) Nightscape 2.O beats Google's Night Sight, in extreme dark conditions. So night photography is one of the best. Though Google pulls out in moderate lightning where it gives more natural edges and corners in the picture.14) No ads like Xiomi or other brands. The OS is premium and butter smooth. There are no bloatwares.15) One of the best device for gaming with gaming mode, best GPU, and added modes like fanatic mode.16) One Plus doesn't spend more on IP certification. This doesn't mean that the phone fails. Have any doubt, please check out the YouTube videos from multiple sources and you'll get to know that the device can withstand in water for long.17) Corning Gorilla Glass 6 on front, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 at the back though the glass back can attract fingerprints. So recommend that you use the case provided which is decent.18) Gestures on Oxygen OS is heaven. Using navigation gestures can give you a full screen experience apart from the notch.19) One Plus is quite quick in updates. I received my first update on the receiving day itself.20) Optic AMOLED display is top quality. You'll not feel putting the phone down. ♥️21) Slow motion in 1080p at 240fps is available.22) The pricing of the phone is fair, and it's the best value for money if you can sacrifice a bit more storage or ram at 33k.23) Haptic feedback is top quality but not best compared to OP7Pro24) The delivery from Amazon was super fast. I got it delivered free in 48 hrs.Cons: 1) One Plus don't provide 3.5mm headphone jack anymore. But neither does it provide a USB 3.1 dongle or headphones in box.2) Camera bump is protruding, so you'll have to use the case that is provided to eliminate this issue.3) Stock Camera app needs to get proper updates to utilize the hardware to its maximum capacity. Hopefully in coming months if not days.4) Matte finish model is not available for 7 though it's available for 7Pro.5) If you love red color, you're not getting it for 33k. It's only available for 38k.6) The pre applied protector is quality one, but it is not a tempered glass. So you'll have to spend and extra 1000 to get the one plus designed tempered glass.7) The provided silicon case is premium, but not one which can give your phone the much better protection on falls. So you'll have to spend an extra 1k or 1.5k for a one plus made case.Device Review conclusion is that this is the best phone in categories like:1) Performance - Fastest Android device on earth now and speed tests with OP7Pro revealed that this set is slightly faster than 7 Pro because of the 60Hz display, and smaller screen size.2) Best value for money if you are one who bought the 128GB version, as there is UFS 3.O available and you can store your data to external drives or laptop.3) This phone is jack of all trades and master of few if not all things.4) Battery endurance5) Top Display for typical use and gaming.6) Uses one of the best camera sensors from Sony that's the Sony IMX 586.7) Night photography with Nightscape 2.O. is one of the best in business right now.8) UI is superb.10) Customer care support is 24x711) Cutomizations are premium.12) Practical buy than it's elder brother Pro. This handset maintained the tagline Flagship Killer with it's pricing and features adopted from 7Pro.Things you'll miss out from One Plus 7Pro -1) An ultrawide angle lens which we don't use in 90% of photography.2) A 90Hz refresh rate, which is amazing but drains your battery by one third.3) A bazeless display given that the Pro uses a motorized pop up camera. But 7 uses a camera notch which is quicker than 7Pro in terms of face unlock and saves a bit on battery.4) A 300 mah more on battery, but endurance wise not better than 7. Also it adds to the weight of the phone as 7Pro weighs 200+ grams and 7 weighs 180+5) Curved edges and Horizon notification lightning is available in 7Pro which we miss on 7.6) The upper speaker grill is quality plastic on 7 and metallic on 7Pro. Not an issue.7) Sim Tray is plastic in 7 but metallic in 7Pro. Not an issue.8) You'll get a slightly bigger screen on 7Pro. But I don't appreciate too big screen sizes. So happy with this one personally.9) You'll be getting a 20w dash charger with 7 and 30w warp charger for 7Pro. But after 50% dash charging speed beats the speed of warp charger and finish the job in a better rate compared to warp.10) You'll get a Matte finish variant in 7Pro which you won't get in 7.11) In 7Pro there is no camera bump protruding as much on 7.Camera Review:Potrait mode in daylight - Stock Camera brings the best bokeh effect and natural colors. While the GCam color tends to be warmer and bokeh effect is missed in most cases.Normal Camera Mode - The Stock Camera brings natural colors and better exposure but GCam beats in better dynamic range, better details. But GCam lags by having a warmer tone and poor exposure.Selfies in Potrait and Normal mode - GCam gives more of a natural color in artificial lighting conditions than Stock Camera but it is beaten by Stock Camera in outdoor conditions. Always use the Bokeh effect in GCam or Stock cam for selfies as it brings out the best picture.Nightscape 2.O is an absolute killer in extreme dark conditions, where GCam struggled to pull out details. But in moderate lightning conditions use the GCam as it brings a more natural color tone, more natural edges, and more details with better exposure. Also in normal night photography, Nightscape 2.O brings better exposure and better lighting but struggles when it comes to natural edges, and natural details.To conclude, the device has a camera hardware which is extremely good and the comparison tests revealed the same. A few software updates can solve the existing cons given what you have on table right now. For the meantime it's the preference of the user whether he can sacrifice few things between using GCam and Stock Camera app."", 'Was using OnePlus2, yesterday got OnePlus 7.

It\'s kind of an initial review, based on 2-3 days of usage.So, for first impressions, OnePlus 7 is a great phone. It is a true ""flagship killer"", a worthy successor of the OnePlus 6T, and most importantly, the best value for money OnePlus 7 series smartphone in the market, when compared to its elder brother, the OnePlus 7 Pro. I bought the 8 GB RAM, 256 GB Storage variant, the original price of which is INR 37,999 and the same variant for OnePlus 7 Pro costs INR 52,999. The things you get for the extra 15k you pay are:1. Larger, better screen with better resolution (Curved QHD display with 90 Hz refresh rate)2. 2 more camera lenses (Wide angle and Telephoto lenses)3. Pop-up selfie camera4. 300 mAh more batteryFor me, camera is not a priority on my phone, and the extra battery doesn\'t serve much, as the larger screen and better resolution display consume much more than that. Thus the overall battery life in the 7 Pro eventually becomes  lesser than that of OnePlus 7. No doubt, the 90 Hz display will give you a much smoother experience, while browsing, scrolling and in some games also (Note: PUBG, Asphalt 9 etc. do not support 90 Hz refresh rate). Otherwise, you get all the best features that are in 7 Pro. So personally, I don\'t feel that the OnePlus 7 Pro is worth that extra money. Best features you get in the OnePlus 7 that are exactly same as the 7 Pro are:1. Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Octa Core Processor2. Adreno 640 GPU3. UFS 3.0 Storage4. Fnatic Mode (Extreme Gaming Mode)5. Zen Mode6. 48 MP Primary Back Camera with  Sony Sensor7. 16 MP Front Camera with Sony Sensor8. Dual Stereo Speakers with Dolby Atmos9. Screen RecordingWith these features on the OnePlus 7, it already becomes an absolute beast of a phone. The combination of the highest quality CPU and Oxygen OS, gives you the smoothest and cleanest of experience you\'ll ever have in any Android smartphone currently in the market (even smoother than the Google Pixel 3 series and the Samsung S10 series). Looks wise, it is almost identical to its predecessor OnePlus 6T, with slightly changed keys positions and a little more camera bump (not a problem for me). OnePlus should have increased the 3700 mAh battery, but that\'s ok, it doesn\'t bother much, unless you play games for very long period of time.Listed below are some Pros and Cons of the OnePlus 7:PROS:  1. Display is quite bright, no issues in viewing in bright sunlight  2. Smooth scrolling and browsing experience  3. Great RAM management  4. Faster and extremely responsive under-display finger-print sensor  5. Faster, more accurate face unlock feature  6. Gaming experience is excellent (specially with the Fnatic Mode on)  7. Cameras are descent enough, clicks sharp and clear images  8. Better nightscape and portrait modes  9. Feels really good and comfortable to hold in one hand10. Corning Gorilla Glass 6 and 5 protection at front and back respectively11. Zen Mode is a really nice feature to keep you away from the phone for some time12. Faster file transfer and app opening (due to the UFS 3.0 storage)CONS:  1. Speakers are not that loud  2. No 3.5 mm headphone jack  3. OnePlus didn\'t even provide a USB Type-C to 3.5 mm dongle in the box  4. Camera is not as good as Google Pixel 3 series or Samsung S10 series or Huawei P30 Pro, but can surely competeOverall, the OnePlus 7 is worth buying. Based on my usage till date, I\'m extremely satisfied with it and I would highly recommend it. If you already have a OnePlus 6T, you need not upgrade to OnePlus 7. But if you are planning to change your old phone and buy a new one, go for the OnePlus 7. It\'s indeed the best value for money smartphone with premium features.', 'Awesome experience using this phone but did not get Type C earphones with this..', 'Have been using the phone for a week now. And one thing that Oneplus always assures users of is the Performance. I have been using OnePlus One till now and it is still as new as it was the first day i bought it (except that its back panel broke and i could find new one). It was the same reason that i purchased a One Plus device again. it gives you a peace of mind that the device will live upto your expectations for years without compromising on the performance.The battery life of this phone is amazing, the software is bloat free, the Snapdragon 855 SoC is amazingly fast. Coupled with 6GB RAM, this phone is like butter. Apps run and open fast, Videos are amazing to watch, Charging is super fast, and the dual Speaker setup is amazingly loud and clear. No Need for external speakers, It can easily fill up a room with clear, crystal sound. I am not an avid selfie clicker or rear camera user so have not clicked many pics, but it is safe to say that the Camera quality is not upto the mark even though the main senser is 48MP. I heard that Oneplus is pushing a new update for the camera which hope to upgrade the picture quality. I am still waiting for that update. Once it is done, will share the camera samples.All in all a great device and will recommend this to everyone who wants to use the device for long time and is an avid game player and movie watcher.', 'The new Oneplus 7 appears almost identical to Op 6t and I felt difficulty to find out a noticeable difference at the first glance, except for the colour. Even the official OP 6t flip cover and tempered glass protector fit nicely with OP 7, but you can’t use the back case because of the placement of the power switch, alert slider and volume rocker. My observations after a day of moderate to heavy use are:1. Design and look: Not new to a OP 6t user like myself, but Mirror Grey colour is more appealing than the Mirror Black. Buttons are better placed than OP 6t.2. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock are faster and more responsive.3. Appears a bit faster but I failed to detect any commendable difference from OP 6t.4. Sound output is definitely better.5. Camera performance is slightly better than OP 6t, but focusing suffers in low light situation. Low light performance has been improved (see photo attached) but needs further improvement. Hope, the problem will be solved by future updates.6. Video quality has been improved but still not comparable to its competitors.7. Battery back up appears to be slightly better than OP 6t possibly due to 7nm Snapdragon 855 SOC, but it is too early to make any inference.8. Excellent value for money; at 33000 bucks it’s a hot cake.9. Absence of a USB C to 3.5 mm audio adapter in the box is a great disappointment.10. I did not test its gaming performance, but it will be at least as good as OP 6t.Its too early to arrive at any inference, but it’s a nice flagship phone for day to day use. However, in my opinion, the existing OP 6t users may ignore the new OP Avtar as this one is a good but not great upgrade. I will make a full list of my observations after using it thoroughly.', 'Screen protector is not proper.  Air beens all over screen.', ""Pros :-1. Speed - Its buttery smooth!!!2. Display - Super bright and colors are awesome3. UI and OS - Its very simple,stable and customizable. Even small animations are really good.I just love OxygenOS.4. Build quality5. Camera - Stock camera app is not so great. Installed GCam and it is superb. You can really feel a big difference. Low light images and portraits are just awesome.6. Battery - I just need to charge once in 24 hrs. Getting a 7 hr plus screen on time.7. Call quality8. Ringer switch9. Fast charging10. Performance - Never felt any lagCons :-1. Speakers : Even if it is very loud it feels very flat during notifications2. Absence of 3.5mm jack. Could've provided a dongle which I had to buy separately.3. Camera bump on the back. Had to buy a case.4. Front cam and teardrop notch- Front cam is good but not that great.5. Fingerprint sensor - Having issue sometimes. But it is blazing fast most of the times though.Overall : Superb value for money if you want to get flagship quality on mid range.Highly satisfied.""]"

Oxygen OS (best OS for Android available for users with timely updates)2. Superfast user experience with no lags or stutters3. 20W Dash Charging (50% charge in 30 mins & max 1.5 hrs for full charge even when you are using the phone) with good battery life4. Full HD+ AMOLED display5. Stereo speakers6. UFS 3.0 storage (Honestly there is no real life difference between UFS 2.1 & UFS 3.0 storages)7. Thin & lightweight mobile (Other mobiles in this price range are heavier and thicker - This matters as most of us use back cases for our phones and this phone comes handy)Don't consider this phone if you want -1. 3.5 mm audio jack (No audio jack)2. Full screen sisplay (Has a notch for front facing camera - Personally I feel a camera notch is better than a motorized camera as it provides durability, is futureproof and has faster face unlock)3. 4000 to 5000 mAh battery (Has 3700 mAh battery)4. Back camera bump (But you can cover it with a good back case)For PUBG users there is an option in the oneplus 7 for hiding the notch area with black screen by disabling the apps to use the notch area. By enabling this option you can have a seamless gaming experience without having to bother about the notch while gaming.Lastly to conclude, I was waiting for the Redmi K20 pro and Asus 6z to be available in India and then consider the best phone to buy but I chose oneplus over these 2 phones as I don't like MIUI with ads and motorized camera (Face unlock is delayed pertaining to this) in Redmi K20 pro and it is only available in flash sales which are really annoying as you cannot buy the phone you want with ease when you really want to. And Asus 6z has no AMOLED screen even in this price range and I am not a fan of motorized camera as I have mentioned it earlier. Also both these phones are heavier and thicker.So previous oneplus users should consider this phone without any doubt and other users should compare it with Redmi K20 pro & Asus 6z and then choose the best phone for them according to their preferences.In my opinion Redmi K20 pro is the best option if your budget is below 30k and Asus 6z is nearly a complete smartphone with 5000 mAh battery and this will be my 2nd option but I chose oneplus 7 over these two phones and I have no regrets.Hope this review is helpful for buyers with the budget of around 30k."", ""Actually I never bought any cellphone of having cost 33000 because I thought why should I invest su ch a big amount in a cellphone as other phones of ranging between 10-15k gives same features.But when I switched to Oneplus .

Oneplus gives 855 snapdragon processor with 6gb ram which is sufficient for gaming lovers.And it's major plus point it's charging adapter it is 30watt 3.2mA charger. My phone charged 0-90% in just 30-35 minutes.It has also some Cons oneplus did not provided any type c to 3.5 mm converter.The camera extrusion is quite thicker than 6T.Overall performance is great.You will not get these features in any other devices in this range.So,Just go for it...Thank you."", 'Perfect smartphone', 'Positive:-*Great Battery Life*Awesome Display*Performance*Gaming is amazin, pubg runs on highest settings*Dash charging*Service support*Awesome sound through the stereo speakers*Great front and rear camera*Awesome Software experience*Netflix works on HDR Settings only few phones can do that*Pricing*Resale Value*SBI Instant discount when buyingNegative:-*No Water proof rating*No headphone jack*No 3.5mm to type c dongle for headphones*No wide angle camera option', ""Switched from the poco-f1 to OP with this.

The battery life and expensive accessories and jack are major drawbacks.Family member is still using the poco and I might just go back to it.I still give 4 stars because the phone is actually good if you're coming from a lower specced phone.

It is further learnt that Amazon would replace only when the mobile is defective or does not function properly - physical problems not affecting the apparent functioning does not qualify for replacement.

Using it since then heavily and there is no way the decision to buy this phone can go wrong. Redmi poco loco fanbois please stay away from this review because this review is for OnePlus and this device is amazing.Pros:-1) Buttery smooth 6.41"" optic AMOLED display. You just can\'t move your eyes from away the screen. The colors are sharp and give you a true cinematic feel.2) Snappy snapdragon 855 SoC:- Well it doesn\'t really need any introduction. It is one of the best processor out there. This is on par or I would say faster than Apple\'s A12 bionic and Exynos 9820. Everything works with virtually no lag at all.3) UFS 3.0 storage:- Latest storage technology. You won\'t get any better than this at this price point. Even S10+ has UFS 2.1 and it costs 73990/-.4) Oxygen OS:- Been using 3T for the past 2.5 years and I am in love with this UI. Far better than laggy MIUI and its ads 😂5) New and improved on screen fingerprint scanner:- It unlocks the phone in a jiffy.6) New and improved haptic vibration motor.7) Dolby Atmos:- A very huge improvement in the speaker department by Oneplus. Dolby atmos is so addictive and immersive.8) Premium build quality:- Gorilla glass 6 on the front and a curved Gorilla glass 5 on the back gives you a feel like you are holding a phone worth 60k above.Now let\'s talk about some letdowns :(Cons:-1) Camera:- This is one department where OnePlus is still struggling to beat some of the flagships like iPhone and Galaxy series. But at this price tag it is justifiable. Hope it gets better with the future updates.2) Absence of headphone jack:- They should have at least provided the Type C to 3.5 mm connector in the box. A workaround is using Bluetooth earphones3) Rear Camera bump:- It is quite potruding outside. But given the glass back you ll forced to use a back cover and then the bump would not be felt.Apart from this everything about this phone stands class apart.You won\'t get any better deal than in 30999/-(including SBI discount).If you are confused between Redmi k20 pro and this, I would recommend go for OnePlus 7. You won\'t regret it at all.', ""I bought this mobile one plus 7 yesterday. My ringtone is permanently on mute mode and it won't budge.

If you are planning to go for it just read this review.DISPLAY : Vibrant and Vivid. Media looks immersive and games look amazing. Gorilla glass prevents scratches. Only  offtrack is the notch , but depending on your taste you can mask it or let it be. Display is edge to edge with a  little wide chin at bottom.SPEAKERS : The sound is so rich and loud that you will binge watch videos all day. Thanks to Dolby Atmos Surround  sound dual speakers sound can be felt on the body of the device.BUILD : Phone is perfectly built and looks premium from every angle. Buttons are very responsive. Back is prone to  smudges just like any other glass panel. Included TPU case is high quality and can help you to hold the phone  more confidently without slipping. Absence to 3.5mm is questioning though OP should have included a  C-3.5 converter. In display fingerprint sensor is surprisingly fast and works in all orientation. Haptic feedback  is much more precise. Even though OnePlus isn't IP certified, it is waterproof to a good extent.CAMERA : In my opinion camera is fairly good and produces good pictures. Some OTA updates or few camera mod  apps can help you get even more beautiful shots. Low light brings in some noise though. OIS is present  for stable video recording.OPERATING SYSTEM : I don't even need to tell about this. Oxygen OS just flows like water. Lots of features yet light to  use. No adware or preloaded apps except Amazon and Netflix which I think are omnipresent. Face Unlock  works like a charm. SD 855 is a beast and can handle anything you throw at it. Even 6gb Ram is adequate  for moderate users. Updates are fast as Oneplus is reputed for this. Gesture Navigation is thoughtful and  looks real for long term usage. App drawer is present. Netflix fullHD is supported.BATTERY : It can last you a day easily with moderate usage. Dash charger comes to rescue and can quickly fill the juice  even in 30mins (30%-80%).VERDICT :  If you are looking for a flagship quality device in sub 40,000 range , Oneplus 7 is an established all rounder.  Oppo Reno has better camera but not a good software. Asus Zenfone 6 lacks an Amoled display and Redmi  K20 pro even with similar specifications can't compete with OP quality and MIUI is bug/Ads infested. Also  all of the other brands lag in android updates.  So, just go for it and you will not regret it.

In my review, I will go over the pros and cons of this devicePROS1) It has the Snapdragon 855, which delivers excellent performance- this processor is extremely fast and can run most mobile titles such as Fortnite or PUBG at highest settings without any lag or frame drops.2) The camera quality is excellent, and Nightscape and portrait mode are two very useful features that OnePlus has implemented well on this phone3) It looks and feels premium in the hand, the glass back makes it look very nice4) It has a great battery life with 20W dash charging which is still extremely fast at charging up the device. With an intensive workload of playing games and browsing Instagram on mobile data with brightness at Max, it lasted nearly the entire day.5) It has a good price at 33,000 INR and also has support for international LTE bands, which makes it a good phone for travelling.6) finally, the in-display finger print reader is fast, faster than some capacitive readers such as the one on the iPhone 7.CONS1) It doesn\'t have the third lens of the OnePlus 7 Pro or the 90Hz screen - these are features that would have further enhanced the product2) it also can get hot while playing games, but not so hot that you would drop your phoneOverall, this is a great phone with all the features that one needs at this price point.

I have been using the phone for the last 8 days or so and it's been great so far. Please take the negative feedbacks with a pinch of salt, because most of those are from people either having a very high expectation or are ignorant about the fact that they knew about the specification very well from the start, before buying.Complaining about the phone being heavy, not having a 3.5mm converter (yes, that's something OnePlus should've given inside the box) but let's be honest everyone knew about it. Then there are people complaining about it heating and the finger print scanner being slow, neither of which is true.Every phone has their own issues, it's nothing new. But if you are looking for a flagship phone at a decent price (compared to the Samsungs and iPhones) then I'll say, go for it."", 'Product is really good but not giving ear phones is bad atleast a jack is not provided.', 'Pros: -In-display finger print works great.Fastest processor in the market makes the device ultra-speed. Yes of course Oxygen OS also plays vital role for the mobile speed.There is no lag while playing games. We can use full graphics settings.Dual Dolby speaker is awesome I don’t need any Bluetooth speaker anymore.Premium and classy look.Fast charging seems really good.Cons: -Camera is not up to the mark. Nightscape mode damaging the image quality. And we cannot get the clear details in the stock camera. I have installed GCam and its works better and can shot clear pixels than the stock camera.I hope One+ will sort out this issue soon in next update.Overall this is the value for money flagship mobile. We don’t need to worry about the quality since everyone knows about how the quality of One+ is. So it is worth a buy for this price range.']"

The user interface and the animations are wonderful. The face detection and the on screen fingerprint sensor works absolutely right. From the features list could see that the camera sensors are very good however I felt both the front and rear camera could produce better images. I hope One Plus releases a software update to improve the camera captures nevertheless the camera is great compared to other phones. Charging the phone has never been so ease, charges the phone approximately in 50 minutes. Removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack and not providing a Type C to 3.5 mm connector was a disappointment.

Everything of the phone is perfect as stated in other reviews.I will straightaway come to the cons. Basically it is just a con. Everything else fits in perfect.Camera performance will disappoint you sometimes, it actually struggles with shadows in bright light, red and blue color is not color accurate, but surprises you with amazing shots. But no worries, it will definitely improve with updates.Best Performance phone in the price range ! It has no competetion in the market.Zenfone 6 has motorised flip camera which will not feel good as you spent more time with it. You will definitely feel annoying after sometime. Unless you are a vlogger, this phone will help you in taking better front shots.K20 Pro has a lower price, but ad free OS is worth the price, although it is claimed to be the fastest but, I myself checked the Antutu Score for the OP7, it was above 363239 which pretty close the claimed score of Redmi's flagship, which maybe of the highest spec version (as it is not specified in advertisement). If you are low on a budget then, surely you can go for the Redmi killer. But trust me, for better experience buy OP :)Thank you :)You will definitely enjoy the beast.

You'll find the appraisals elsewhere because honestly you know it's a great phone for the price. So I'll write about some of the technical issues I faced over time. Maybe it's not the same experience with everyone but my OnePlus finds it difficult to adjust the auto brightness mode by itself. It's so annoying at times.Fingerprint sensor is okay but not as great as Samsung's.Camera should have better software. Guys chant about pictures like DSLR's and having awesome blur effect but neither google can flawlessly blur background except for simple selfies or objects like a Rubik's cube or a flower taken in macro. These technologies are developing and I hope future OnePlus version will have proper camera algorithms.And guys if you prefer wired earphones because they don't run out of battery or better value for money, then sorry but these phones don't come with 3.5 mm audiojack and they are not currently selling the type c to 3.5 mm converter even on official OnePlus store.

This phone is buttery smooth and blazing fast.2. AMOLED display is sharp and colour accurate.3. Dolby Atmos speakers sound pretty good.4. Face unlock may not be secure but it is amazingly fast.5. Great battery backup (I love dark themes and since AMOLED display uses less power for dark background, this is a win-win situation).6. Awesome build quality.7. Dash charging is really great.Cons:1. No headphone jack.2. They haven't even provided Type C to 3.5mm adapter in the box. This is the most frustating thing for me. This adapter is out of stock right now. I either have to wait for sometime or buy bluetooth earphone.3. Camera quality doesn't meet the expectation. This may look good only in specs sheet.4. Transparent back case they provided in the box fits okay but the 4 corners looks bulged and kinda ugly.This is just my thoughts on using the phone for 1 day. I'll try to provide detailed review after using it for many days."", ""It is just the perfect and most balanced phone you can get at this price.

I really didn't feel that it is a 6GB RAM piece. The phone often strucks in apps. During Video calls it strucks, using shopping apps it strucks.

DC dimming feature works abit but it won't completely remove the distortion. Overall it's a pretty strong phone in market right now.P.S. Oneplus should have provided type c to 3.5mm audio jack cable like they did in 6T."", ""So i ordered OP7 red color variant, being an OP5 user there wasn't much of instant surprise to see the phone. The delivery was prompt so thumbs-up for that. The screen looks huge, and the phone is bulky. The look and feel of phone oozes finesse. The red color looks really catchy, one cant ignore it to look once more. The phone comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent cover to protect the glass back as soon as you take it out of the box.Coming to features, the 48 MP camera looks very slow in focusing objects that makes it not a snapper at all. The selfie camera is good and comes along with beautification feature. Coming to the on screen finger print reader, i must say its not fully cooked, and needs lot of refinement, already in 3 days i had around 10% failure. But as it comes with face -unlock so doesnt hamper much. Battery life is good, can last a whole day with 2-3 rounds of PUBG.Fanatic mode has a catch as it stops alerting for anything, not even calls which can be dangerous a times, so chose wisely when to enable fanatic mode.The touch is very smooth, though i felt that if you dont click the icon in center it doesnt open, which wasnt the case with OP5, again a failure of 5% which someone can ignore.Coming to speakers, its really effective and can be heard from a long distance and even the haptic feed is good.Overall a nice package but could have been better, but there comes the price trade-off.

Make sure you go to sound option, dolby and select dynamic and try it out.5) Display is just superb. You can pinch in while watching YouTube for fullscreen with notch and gives an amazing experience.6)  Phone fits perfectly even if your hands are small.7) UFS 3.0 is just amazing.8) I did intensive gaming only and got battery backup of 4 - 4.5 hours, not 6-8 hours which is being shown by the youtubers. Mixed usage i got 1.2 days, slightly less usage, 1.2 days and (i never tried this but when the battery is charged it shows backup will easily last 2 days)9) Fingerprint scanner works like a charm. Very fast and responsive. But if your hands are wet is doesn't work all the time i experienced that a little it does work only with some angle.10) Fast Charger provided is damn good, my phone charges from 0-100 in exact 80 mins. Don't worry if your battery drains fast you got a fast charger as well.11) No words for gaming experience, i am a hardcore gamer. Just one game to understand it better PUBG FULL GRAPHICS = NO LAG.CONS1) Front camera needs to be improved the images look more smudged which is not a big deal and can be improved in the software update.2) 3.5 mm headphone jack is missing which is major loss because, Oneplus is not providing you with a inbox converter you must purchase it from thier site whick gets sold quicker than the flash sale on Amazon. So i had to order one more 3rd party converter.Guy's overall Oneplus did a great job.1) Still i would say people who are confused to buy between oneplus 7/ 7 pro, my suggestion is go with Oneplus 7 (8gb+256gb type). The only difference is pop up camera, 90hz refresh rate and 3 cameras (which is not actually that usefull) this is just my opinion but peoples choices differ from thier usage.

Personally, had i not bought this 3 days back, i would have gone with Honor 20/Pro for the same price but better design, and better configuration. Kirin 980 is as good as SD 855.""]"
